# DHCP and DNS Server
In order to create the web server, as well as order types of servers, I had to build a general purpose server (one that includes DHCP and DNS).

This server is built in a virtual machine, using a Linux environment. The first thing you are going to notice is that this server has no graphic interface, that meaning that you are using only command line.
